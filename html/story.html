            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Terrorism has been in the news a lot the last couple of years and this might give people the impression that the risk of a terrorist attack occuring in their country has grown.
              Despite the intense media focus on terrorist activity around the world, the numbers of people actually killed by terrorist attacks has remained low. Terrorism only killed 13,000 in 2010, a relatively low number when compared with other types of violent death, namely armed conflict and interpersonal violence.<sup><a href='https://oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/what-if-we-allocated-aid-based-on-how-much-damage-something-does-and-whether-we-know-how-to-fix-it/'>1</a></sup>
              While acts of terrorism across the globe have increased markedly in recent decades, in most parts of the world it continues to be a relatively rare event and is instead focused in particular countries or regions of instability.
              Ignorance on this subject could lead to unnecessary bias.

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
              The goal of this website is to provide more insight in the trend of terrorist incidents in the period of 1990 till 2017.
              Furthermore it hopefully provides in-depth information about terrorist attacks for different countries. This is done by
              visualizing data about terrorist groups, attacktypes, targettypes and weapontypes that are behind terrorist attacks for every country per year.
              This website is aimed at people who don't know a lot about (the trend in) global terrorism and want to learn more about it.
              It hopes to take away any bias (if any) people had as a result of the intense media focus on terrorist attacks.

            <h2>Does terrorism work?</h2>
            <p>
              Measuring the effectiveness of terrorism requires us to have both a well defined set of objectives for a given terrorist organisation as well as a definite way to determine success and failure.
              Consider the example of 9/11 and whether Al-Qaeda achieved its objectives: If the objective was to destroy America, then it clearly failed.
              Yet if the goal was to intimidate America and publicise the cause, it may be considered a success.
