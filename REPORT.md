# Global Terrorism

### Description
This is my visualisations page on the subject Global Terrorism. There are three linked views: a worldmap, a multiple linegraph and a donutchart. The worldmap shows the number of terrorist incidents in the world. The linegraph shows the number of fatalities, non-fatal injuries and terrorist incidents. Finally the donut can show 4 types of categorial data: terrorist groups, attack types, target types and weapon types.
