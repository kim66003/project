### <u>Jan 7, 2019:</u>
- Adjusted some things in my proposal
- Processed and converted dataset to JSON file with Pandas

I didn't commit my python script and processed data on this day because my dataset was too big to upload (I already emailed about this) but I did work on it.

### <u>Jan 8, 2019:</u>
- On this day I decided to filter my dataset down to data in the period 2000-2017 instead of using all the data (1970 - 2017) because my dataset was too big to work with
- I also filtered the 135 columns down to 61 columns with variables that looked most interesting to me
- I changed this in my proposal as well
- Worked on my DESIGN.md
- Created globalterrorism.js and index.html to test if I could console.log and manipulate data
