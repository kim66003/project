### <u>Jan 7, 2019:</u>
- Adjusted some things in my proposal
- Processed and converted dataset to JSON file with Pandas

I didn't commit my python script and processed data on this day because my dataset was too big to upload (I already emailed about this) but I did work on it.

### <u>Jan 8, 2019:</u>
- On this day I decided to filter my dataset down to data in the period 2000-2017 instead of using all the data (1970 - 2017) because my dataset was too big to work with
- I also filtered the 135 columns down to 61 columns with variables that looked most interesting to me
- I changed this time period (1970-2017 to 2000-2017) in my proposal as well
- Worked on my DESIGN.md
- Created globalterrorism.js and index.html to test if I could console.log and manipulate data

### <u>Jan 9, 2019:</u>
- Changed some main features in proposal
- Added:
-- donut chart
-- dropdown menu (countries)
-- slider (years)
-- dropdown check menu (categorial variable)
- Deleted:
-- Bar graph

-- Two dropdowns (country and year)
- Added bar chart/histogram to "optional"
<i>Data is still not commited to github because file is too big but it does exist</i>

### <u>Jan 11, 2019:</u>

On this day I didn't commit anything to github because I was working on my data again with the original dataset (158mb) so this was too big to commit again. I found out  that I had to reformat my data because I had to get the frequencies of some variables in a new dataframe (with pandas) and I was struggling with this a lot. My data looked like this:

And I wanted it to look like this:
